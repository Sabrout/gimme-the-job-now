# Technical interview

## Data Engineering / Back-end

## About

First of all, thank you for your interest in becoming a new member of our software engineering team ! üöÄ

As you're reading this document, it means that you are about to perform one of Inarix's technical interview. Be sure to respect the 24 hours limits of this test üôè.

This technical interview is data engineering / back-end dev. oriented, which means that you are about to implement a wrapper in python to serve a machine learning model. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate different skills:

- Rigor
- Learning
- Development workflow
- Code quality
- Creativity
- ...

## Technologies

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

## Requirements

**Should be able:**

- to request the machine learning model to perform a prediction
- to customize the wrapper in order to adapt it to my machine learning model

## Tasks

### Practice

In this technical test, you'll have to implement a wrapper that will be able to take any machine learning model written in python and serve it as an API. It'll be used by our data science team and then deployed in a kubernetes cluster.

**Basics**

1. Create a **private** github repository and add as a contributor `@cesumilo`
2. Crush this technical interview ! :punch:

**Features**

- Warm-up

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to warm-up different services
  Because I need to use several services to perform a prediction
```

- Pre-processing

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to apply pre-processing functions
  Because I need to transform the given input data into a model suitable inputs
```

- Post-processing

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to apply post-processing functions
  Because I need to transform the generated output data into suitable output format for the Inarix api.
```

- Custom prediction

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to implement a custom prediction function
  Because sometimes I need to apply specific behavior to my model
```

- Usability

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to use the wrapper as simply as possible
  Because I want to experiment as fast as possible for any given model

  Example: terminal interface
```

- Portability

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to use the wrapper on any operating system
  Because data science team use a variety of them (windows, mac os, linux)
```

- Deployment

```text
  As a data science team member
  I want to be able to run the server locally
  Because I need to perform predictions and evaluate my model
```

**Notes**

We added a little example of code that we would like to serve using your wrapper. Don't modify the code, just use it to provide an example.

**Bonus**

- Production-ready :smirk:
- Fully tested (with coverage report, etc) üòç
